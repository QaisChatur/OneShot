# OneShot

CISC226 Project: Qais C, Piero A, Stephan L

OneShot is a thrilling shooter where you have only one bullet in your chamber and a melee weapon as a backup. If you miss your shot, you have to rely on your melee skills to survive and get another chance to fire. The game is challenging and rewarding, as the difficulty increases with every second. Good Luck!
